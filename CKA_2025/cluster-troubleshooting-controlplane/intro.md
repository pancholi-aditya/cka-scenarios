# Cluster Troubleshooting – Control Plane Failure

A Kubernetes cluster has recently undergone a migration.

After the migration, the cluster is **not functioning correctly** and
some **control plane components are down**.

---

## Task

Troubleshoot the cluster and **restore it to a healthy state**.

Once fixed:

- The API server must be reachable
- Control plane components must be running
- The cluster must report a healthy status
