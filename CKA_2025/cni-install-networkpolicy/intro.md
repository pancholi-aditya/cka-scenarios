# Install and Configure CNI with NetworkPolicy Support

In this scenario, you will install and configure a Container Network Interface (CNI)
that supports native Kubernetes NetworkPolicy.

### Requirements

- The CNI must support NetworkPolicy
- Choose **one** option:
  - Flannel version 0.26.1
  - Calico version 3.28.2

### Notes

- Only one CNI must be installed
- Installing both CNIs is incorrect
