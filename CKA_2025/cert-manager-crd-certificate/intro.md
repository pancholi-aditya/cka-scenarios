# cert-manager CRD and Certificate Inspection

In this scenario, you will work with cert-manager resources.

You must:

1. List all CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) created by cert-manager
2. Extract the **subject** field from cert-manager Certificates

Both outputs must be written to files exactly as specified.

This task requires careful use of `kubectl`, resource filtering,
and JSONPath.
